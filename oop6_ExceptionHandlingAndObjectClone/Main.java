    /*

    Major diff between Error and Exception is

    Your program can handle exception but cannot handle errors

    Ex. StackOverflow Error
        FileNotFound Exception

    In Java Throwable class handles all exceptions

    Throwable -> Exception
              -> Error


    Types of Exceptions:
        Checked -> Exceptions that are checked at compile time. Ex. FileNotFound
        Unchecked -> Occurs at RunTime Ex. DivideByZero
