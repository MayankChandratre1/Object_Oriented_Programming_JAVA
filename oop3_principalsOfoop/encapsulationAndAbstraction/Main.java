    /*
        Encapsulation : Wrap the data and methods in some entity in order to protect them

        Abstraction : Hide the complexities and show only essentials to user


        1. Encapsulation is related to implementational issues
            Abstraction deals with the design issues

        2. Abtraction is indirectly achieved with encapsulation

        3. Encapsulation is Containing the info while
            Abstraction is Gaining the info

        4. Analogy:
            Encap: a medicine is put into a capsule and you are only allowed to take it through that
                    capsule.

            Abstr: a car hides its mechanism and only shows controls to driver

         5. Examples:
            Encap: ArrayList class has an array inbuilt , but we cannot access this array we have to
                    use it though the ArrayList object.
            Abstr: We don't care how println prints the data, but we use it everywhere.

          6. Encap is acheived through methods like getters and setters
            Abstr is achieved through classes, abstract classes, interfaces.
